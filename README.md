# NoteIt: The Brain Dump Browser Extention

This browser extension opens up a note-taking sidebar in Chrome, perfect for jotting down various notes. NoteIt stays open as a side bar while you switch tabs, allowing you to take notes while switching frequently between tabs. Individual notes can be deleted, as well as a "delete all" feature. 

Each note includes a title and body text. A unique feature to NoteIt is that it records the link of the website you were on when you created the note and displays it at the bottom of each note, so you can revisit websites you used to take old notes, if needed. The side panel's width can also be changed by dragging the panel out or in. Notes save automatically, so you can close and re-open the side panel whenever.

The dark-mode branch also includes a partly implemented dark mode feature, which hopefully can become fully supported and implemented soon.
