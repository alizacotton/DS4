# DS4

11/23 changes:
- can now create, edit, and automataically save notes
- closing and reopening extension keeps notes saved in Chrome local storage
- Individual notes can be deleted, as well as "delete all" button
- Notes automatically resize for text, and can also be dragged to expand in the bottom right corner of a note

Need to change:
- URL doesn't actually record URL
- "Delete All" positioning doesn't match "My Notes" header
- Half-functioning dark mode (doesn't stay dark)
